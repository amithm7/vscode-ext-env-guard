# Extension Dev

- Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
- Set breakpoints in your code inside `src/extension.ts` to debug your extension.
- Find output from your extension in the debug console.
- You can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after changing code in `src/extension.ts`.
- You can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R`) the VS Code window with your extension to load your changes.
- You can open the full set of our API when you open the file `node_modules/@types/vscode/index.d.ts`.

## Run tests

- Install the Extension Test Runner(`ms-vscode.extension-test-runner`)
- Run the "watch" task via the **Tasks: Run Task** command. Make sure this is running, or tests might not be discovered.
- Open the Testing view from the activity bar and click the Run Test" button, or use the hotkey `Ctrl/Cmd + ; A`
- See the output of the test result in the Test Results view.
- Make changes to `src/test/extension.test.ts` or create new test files inside the `test` folder.
  - The provided test runner will only consider files matching the name pattern `**.test.ts`.
  - You can create folders inside the `test` folder to structure your tests any way you want.
